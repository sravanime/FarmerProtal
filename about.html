              <h2>About us:</h2>
              <p>Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian Economy"- said Mahatma Gandhi six decades ago. Even today, the situation is still the same, with almost the entire economy being sustained by agriculture, which is the mainstay of the villages. It contributes 16% of the overall GDP and accounts for employment of approximately 52% of the Indian population. Rapid growth in agriculture is essential not only for self-reliance but also to earn valuable foreign exchange.

                Indian farmers are second to none in production and productivity despite of the fact that millions are marginal and small farmers. They adopt improved agriculture technology as efficiently as farmers in developed countries. It is felt that with provision of timely and adequate inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and by making available affordable agricultural credit /crop insurance, Indian farmers are going to ensure food and nutritional security to the Nation.It is envisaged to make available relevant information and services to the farming community and private sector through the use of information and communication technologies, to supplement the existing delivery channels provided for by the department. Farmers’ Portal is an endeavour in this direction to create one stop shop for meeting all informational needs relating to Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries sectors production, sale/storage of an Indian farmer. With this Indian Farmer will not be required to sift through maze of websites created for specific purposes.Once in the Farmers’ Portal, a farmer will be able to get all relevant information on specific subjects around his village/block /district or state. This information will be delivered in the form of text, SMS, email and audio/video in the language he or she understands. These levels can be easily reached through the Map of India placed on the Home page. Farmers will also be able to ask specific queries as well as give valuable feedback through the Feedback module specially developed for the purpose.

    <h2><br><strong class="black">AGRICULTURE</strong></h2>
    <p>Agriculture, with its allied sectors, is unquestionably the largest livelihood provider in India, more so in the vast rural areas. It also contributes a significant figure to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Sustainable agriculture, in terms of food security, rural employment, and environmentally sustainable technologies such as soil conservation, sustainable natural resource management and biodiversity protection, are essential for holistic rural development. Indian agriculture and allied activities have witnessed a green revolution, a white revolution, a yellow revolution and a blue revolution.
      This section provides the information on agriculture produces; machineries, research etc. Detailed information on the government policies, schemes, agriculture loans, market prices, animal husbandry, fisheries, horticulture, loans & credit, sericulture etc. is also available.</p>

      <h3 style="color: rgb(163, 28, 10); font-size: 27px;">Harvest</h3>
      <div class="col1">Have you ever wondered how we get food grains supplied neat and cleaned directly to the shop? Yes, farmers are using traditional and modern techniques for Harvesting the crops grown. There are various stages to harvesting a variety of crops when the particular crop attains its maturity. Harvesting the crops at matured levels gives high income, and good quality produces.

        If the crops such as pulses, cereals, oilseeds, etc., are left in the field for too long after maturity without harvesting, it can lead to the predisposition of pests.</div>

      <h3 style="color: rgb(163, 28, 10); font-size:27px;">Cultivation</h3>
      <div class="col1">In agriculture, the loosening and breaking up (tilling) of the soil or, more generally, the raising of crops. The soil around existing plants is cultivated—by hand using a hoe or by machine using a cultivator—to destroy weeds and promote growth by increasing soil aeration and water infiltration. Soil being prepared for the planting of a crop is cultivated by a harrow or plow. Numerous systems have been developed for the cultivation of crops in the long history of agriculture, including terrace cultivation, agroforestry, crop rotation, shifting agriculture, and others.</div>

      <h3 style="color: rgb(163, 28, 10); font-size: 27px;">Protection</h3>
      <div class="col1">Crop protection helps to keep plants healthy and maintain sustainable yields. The choice of plant protection strategy depends on the type of cultures grown and the threat. It can be diseases, insects, or weeds. At the same time, measures must be timely and, wherever possible, preventive. Modern crop protection compounds make extensive use of digital solutions. They enable the precise analysis of soil and plant conditions and provide accurate information about external factors such as weather conditions. At the same time, they allow optimizing the use of resources. As a result, farmers can protect crops, increase profits, and minimize environmental damage.</div>

      <h3 style="color: rgb(163, 28, 10); font-size:27px;">Treatment</h3>
      <div class="col1">Agriculture relies on the growth of seeds. They are the first stage in the lifecycle of a crop and if seeds fail to germinate, crops fail. Seeds face a lot of challenges from diseases to pests to environmental stresses. While seeds can overcome these on their own, the chances of success can be improved with seed enhancement. Seed treatment is one of the most effective ways to support the growth of seeds and reduce the challenges that they face.</div>

      <h3 style="color: rgb(163, 28, 10); font-size:27px;">Crop Management</h3>
      <div class="col1" style="color: rgb(31, 30, 30);">Crop management begins with the sowing of seeds, continues with crop maintenance during growth and development, and ends with crop harvest, storage, and distribution (Tivy, 1990). During seed sowing, a mechanized planter often opens a furrow in the prepared soil seed bed, places the seed in the exposed moist soil, covers the planted seed, and then often packs the soil down to assure firm seed-soil contact. In no-till systems, the crop is planted (“drilled”) directly into the soil through residue from the previous crop.</div>

      <div class="col1" style="color:rgb(31, 30, 30);">Risk is an important aspect of the farming business. The uncertainties inherent in weather, yields, prices, Government policies, global markets, and other factors that impact farming can cause wide swings in farm income. Risk management involves choosing among alternatives that reduce financial effects that can result from such uncertainties.

        Five general types of risk are described here: production risk, price or market risk, financial risk, institutional risk, and human or personal risk.</div>

      <div class="col1" style="color: rgb(31, 30, 30);">Healthy soil is the foundation of productive, sustainable agriculture.

        Managing for soil health allows producers to work with the land – not against – to reduce erosion, maximize water infiltration, improve nutrient cycling, save money on inputs, and ultimately improve the resiliency of their working land.Principles to Improve Soil Health : Minimize Disturbance, Maximize Soil Cover, Maximize Biodiversity, Maximize Presence of Living Roots.</div>

      <h3 style="color: rgb(163, 28, 10); font-size:27px;">Disease And Symptoms</h3>
      <div class="col1" style="color: rgb(31, 30, 30);">The presence of plant diseases on an agricultural farm costs farmers a lot of money. Crop losses owing to animals, diseases, pests, and weeds account for 20 to 40 percent of the overall global agricultural productivity, according to IRJET research. The traditional method of physically analyzing particular aspects of leaves, such as texture, color, and form, to identify infections is not always efficient. As a result, most farmers throughout the world engage professional agriculturists to diagnose diseases in their crops on large farms. It is, however, a time-consuming and costly process.</div>
